              suit. Short and long stays welcome.</p>
            <p>Please note we may require a minimum stay of 2 nights during our busy periods (or 3 nights at bank

            <p>We’ll require a deposit equal to the cost of the first night, paid by card, cheque or bank transfer within 5
              days of booking. If you have to cancel, we’ll return your deposit, less 5% handling charge, as long as you
              give us 14 days notice prior to your booked stay, else your deposit will become non-refundable. You may
              want to consider travel insurance to cover this eventuality.</p>
